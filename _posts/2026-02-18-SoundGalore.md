SoundGalore is a project I started in June of 2026 as a homelab to practice full-stack web development. I chose a stack consisting of React (javascript front-end framework), Flask (python server framwork), and SQL_Alchemy to manage a MySQL database using python (the goal of using SQL_Alchemy is to keep the database as portable as possible). 

SoundGalore itself is a social media website where users can post short-length and medium-length clips of audio, which can be listened to hands-free. The hands-free aspect is really important to SoundGalore, as I feel it's a key differentiator in bridging the gap between short-form video content (Tik Tok, Instagram Reels, Youtube Shorts) and long-form audio content (podcasts, talk radio, audiobooks).

The massive growth of the podcast market has proven that there is a demand for hands free content, but this trend is currently centered around professional long-form entertainment programs, mainly talk shows and audio essays. I think there is an untapped demand for a social media site which is centered around user-created short-form audio-only content, which doesn't drain the users' attention span the way that longer-form content potentially can. Currently, there is no major "hands free social media" but if there were, it would enable users feel a brand new form of social connection through the internet, even as they're vaccuuming or making dinner. 


Tik Tok, has had great success filling the demand for short-form video content, but no one has met the demand for a shorter-form audio content. There is content ready to be created, and listened to, but it only exists in people's minds because the platform does not yet exist, until now. 

SoundGalore isn't just "Voice Twitter" or "Tik Tok Radio" it's a powerful new medium for people form connections, express themselves, and feel surrounded by a rich online community of users who share their spoken words in order to entertain, inform, and inspire each other.
