What did you do last week?:

  Last week I worked on finalizing my proposal, and coming up with a name for the program. Through working on the proposal, I also worked a lot on figuring out what the scope of the project is going to be, and making some initial decisions about how I'm planning to build this. Keeping in mind that this is a short-semester, I'm aiming for a fairly basic website/webapp on mobile (following the mobile-first example of Instagram) that serves its purpose, and then add more advanced features if there's time.


What do you plan to do this week?

  I plan to get a github repo going, and get my basic file structure and boilerplate written, so that I have a blank canvas to work with.


Are there any impediments in your way?

  My main impediment is that I haven't really used REACT besides maybe a small tutorial once or twice. I'm also not sure if REACT will work with Flask and MySQL/SSMS, so I may have to learn some new server and database code as well. 


Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

  Last week my process was about refining my ideas, this week I'm going to be zooming into more technical details i.e. how to actually build the website.
