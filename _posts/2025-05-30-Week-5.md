title: Building Soundgalore Week 5

What did you do last week?


Last week I worked on getting a full stack set up with a front end, Flask backend, and SQL-lite database. I started working on some tables for the database as well. I now have my React boilerplate running on top of a flask server, and I'm using a library called flask_sqlalchemy to work with a SQL-lite database. Running it on localhost, I've confirmed that I have fast-refresh working, which is exciting, and definitely my favorite React feature so far. 



What do you plan to do this week?

I plan to finish making the database tables, and run some basic checks, for example that I can send data to the client, and also retrieve it. Then I plan to also start on designing a main page for the website. I was hoping create the first page last week, but ended up decided it would be best to do some work on the database before diving into the front-end. 



Are there any impediments in your way?

Not currently.  



Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

Last week I changed course a little bit from what I planned by working on the database first rather than going straight for the front-end. I think throughout this project I may have to stay responsive to what the project needs most, even if it differs from my original plans.
