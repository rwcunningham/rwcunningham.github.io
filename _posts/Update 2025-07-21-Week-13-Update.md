What did you do last week?
I finished writing my essay and finished up some final touches on the project. 

What do you plan to do this week?
I plan to put some final touches on my course website, continue to make tweaks.

Are there any impediments in your way?
Nope.

Reflection on the process:
This has been a great experience. I learned a lot about many aspects of web development that I had been curious about.
