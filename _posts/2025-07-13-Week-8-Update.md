Week 8 Update

What did you do last week?
Last week I worked more on the authentication process. I have been short on time so it is still not quite done, but I have learned a lot and am inching much closer to something. 


What do you plan to do this week?
This week I plan to finish the authentication process with an actual login page, and test it, add some users etc. Then I want to work on dishing out actual posts to our "post" page.

Are there any impediments in your way?
Not at this time

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
The process I used last week was to focus on things from the backend perspective, and really focus on researching the concepts to make sure I'm doing things the secure way.
