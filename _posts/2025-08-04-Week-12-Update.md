title: Building SoundGalore Week 12
---
What did you do last week?

Last week I worked on the CSS, and on the file upload page. 

What do you plan to do this week?

Just write the final essay, and try to fix a couple lasting bugs. 

Are there any impediments in your way?

None at all

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

Looking back, there were a lot of places where I just didn't know what I was doing, so now I know what mistakes not to make. I think on a future project, I would honestly commit myself to less of a weekly plan, and rather approach it as deciding which feature from a list of features is the most critical, and try to do that one first. That's de facto how I ended up approaching the project, and sometimes my original plans went out the window. But I still got to a prototype that I'm happy about.
