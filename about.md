About Robert Cunningham

### More Information

I am a Software Engineer, currently residing in Los Angeles, California. 

In December of 2025, I graduated from The University of Colorado - Boulder with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Previously, I have earned a Double Bachelor of Arts from University of Nebraska - Omaha in Music Technology, Jazz Bass Performance, and a minor in IT Innovation.

I'm currently working on personal projects in Web Development, as well as Digital Signal Processing (mainly for Audio). 

One of my projects, SoundGalore, is an audio-based social media, that's intended to be hands-free like a podcast or an audiobook, but with a more amateur, user-created approach. An oversimplified way to describe it is it's a hands-free, audio-only, social media, so users can experience the online community when they're driving or doing tasks around the house. I'm hoping to expand the available features, as well as hone in on the design more, to make it more full-fledged and scalable. 

Another project of mine is an VST plug-in I'm working on for an Equalizer. Programming in C++ using the JUCE framework for DSP (Digital Signal Processing), means that my final .VST file works with essentially any modern day digital audio workstation (FL Studio, Ableton, Reaper, Garageband, etc).  Currently, I've created a single 3-band EQ, but I hope to expand the functionality of this device to include more visualization features, as well as multi-band capability (currently operates a single band of EQ).
